    /* Important knowledge about the Shape utilities.
     * These are made for performance reasons.
     * 
     * Things to remember just using structs, ref structs, and different span types won't be instant better performance.
     * If you are doing a lot of boxing and unboxing of data it can actually be worse performance when using them. 
     * 
     * Boxing is moving data from the stack to the heap
     * Unboxing is moving data from the heap to the stack.
     * 
     * Ref Struct information
     * Ref structs allocated on the stack.
     * Ref structs can not be moved to managed memory aka the heap.
     * Ref structs can not be boxed to System.ValueType or System.Object
     * https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/ref-struct
     
     public void Boxing()
     {
        int i = 10; // Line 1
        object o = i; // Line 2 shows an example of boxing
        int io = (int)o; // Line 3 show an example of unboxing.
     }
     * 
     * Notes to keep in mind when using Unity's Burst Compiler
     * Burst has basic support for getting static readonly data, 
     * but if you want to share a static mutable data between C# and HPC#, you have 
     * to use a SharedStatic<T> struct
     
        public abstract class MutableStaticTest
        {
        public static readonly SharedStatic<int> IntField = SharedStatic<int>.GetOrCreate<MutableStaticTest, IntFieldKey>();

        // Define a Key type to identify IntField
        private class IntFieldKey {}
        }
        
        C# and HPC# can then access this:
        
        // Write to a shared static 
        MutableStaticTest.IntField.Data = 5;
        // Read from a shared static
        var value = 1 + MutableStaticTest.IntField.Data;
     
      
     * This is done by doing the following.
     * 
     * Memory Performance.
     * 1. Use of structs and ref structs for stack allocation instead of heap allocation.
     * 2. Spans and ReadOnlySpans to allow for faster memory caching of the collection data types.
